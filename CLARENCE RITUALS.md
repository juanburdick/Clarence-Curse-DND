## Comprehend Languages
```
Summary: Only as ritual, meaning it takes 10 minutes.
```
```
Cast time: 10 minutes as ritual
Range/Area: Self
Components: V/S/M (a pinch of soot and salt)
Duration: 1 hour
School: Divination
Attack/Save: None
Damage/Effect: Social
```
```
For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.

This spell doesn't decode secret messages in a text or a glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn't part of a written language.

## Identify
```

```
```
Cast time: 11 minutes as ritual
Range/Area: Touch

Duration: Instantaneous
School: Divination
Attack/Save: None
Damage/Effect: Detection
```
```
You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.
```

## Detect Magic
```
Summary: Cursed magic items stay cursed, but attunements can be broken.
```
```
Cast time: Instant-ish
Range/Area: Self (30 ft radius)
Components: V/S
Duration: Permanent
School: Divination
Attack/Save: None
Damage/Effect: Detection
```
```
For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
