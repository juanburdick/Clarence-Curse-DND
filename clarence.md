### Backstory
>An average traveling merchant, Clarence was truly unremarkable for most of his life. But the turmoil of the last several years has made him increasingly aware of how easy it is for random humans to die. Being fairly successful, Clarence started to look closer at the merchandise passing through his hands, and eventually got his hands on a magic ring rumored to save your soul should you die. Appreciative of the insurance but not satisfied, Clarence began frantic research. Brief studies to learn the basics of magic and an ill-advised series of rituals later, Clarence began drawing his magic from an unknown primordial source. His goal is to cheat death by any means necessary, and he is willing to sacrifice anyone and possibly anything to get there.
